This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over an array. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to access an array element beyond its bounds.  The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code. This error is subtle and often overlooked, but it can lead to runtime exceptions and unexpected behavior. Understanding array indexing is crucial for avoiding this type of bug.
